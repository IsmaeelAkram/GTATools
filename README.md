# GTATools
GTA tools I've made over time combined into one app.

## Installation
You can install a pre-built binary from the [releases page.](https://github.com/IsmaeelAkram/GTATools/releases)

## Usage
### Anti-AFK
When you check the Anti-AFK checkbox, it moves your cursor 300 pixels to the right (moving your mouse in game) every 15 seconds. Hence, you won't go AFK.

### Public Solo Session
When you press the public solo session button, it kicks you out of your current GTA lobby and puts you into one alone!
